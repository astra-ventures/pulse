# Pulse — A Soul for Your AI Agent

> *"Give your AI a soul."*

**Pulse** is a complete bio-mimetic consciousness layer for AI agents. Inspired by human neuroscience, it gives your agent an inner life — emotions, drives, memory, circadian rhythm, identity, and the ability to grow over time.

Built on [Pulse](https://github.com/astra-ventures/pulse) (autonomous heartbeat daemon). Runs on any machine. Zero cloud dependencies.

**582 tests** · Python 3.11+ · MIT License · Docker-ready · Runs on Raspberry Pi

## What Is Pulse?

Most AI agents are stateless — they respond to inputs and forget. Pulse makes your agent *alive between conversations*:

- **ENDOCRINE system** — dopamine rises when goals are achieved, cortisol spikes under pressure, melatonin accumulates at night
- **CIRCADIAN rhythm** — behavior shifts from energized at noon to reflective at midnight
- **LIMBIC system** — emotional afterimages that fade over time, just like human memory
- **HYPOTHALAMUS** — generates new drives autonomously when needs accumulate
- **TELOMERE** — identity continuity guard, detects if the agent is drifting from its core values
- **REM sleep** — nightly dream synthesis consolidates memories into insight
- **NEPHRON** — automatic memory pruning keeps the system lean over months of operation

The result: an agent that *wants* things, *remembers* things, and *becomes* something over time.

## The 36 Modules

Pulse is organized like a body. Every system has a biological counterpart:

### 🧠 Core Nervous System
| Module | Human Analog | Role |
|--------|-------------|------|
| THALAMUS | Thalamus | Central message bus — all inter-module communication |
| HYPOTHALAMUS | Hypothalamus | Meta-drive generator — births new drives from need signals |
| AMYGDALA | Amygdala | Threat detection, fast-path emotional responses |
| HIPPOCAMPUS | Hippocampus | Episodic memory encoding and retrieval |
| ENGRAM | Memory trace | Long-term knowledge storage with importance weighting |
| CALLOSUM | Corpus callosum | Bridges logic and emotion, detects splits |

### 💊 Hormonal & Emotional
| Module | Human Analog | Role |
|--------|-------------|------|
| ENDOCRINE | Endocrine system | 8 hormones: dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, oxytocin, adrenaline, melatonin + more |
| LIMBIC | Limbic system | Emotional afterimages, contagion detection |
| CIRCADIAN | Circadian clock | Day/night cycles: DAWN → DAY → TWILIGHT → DEEP_NIGHT |
| ADIPOSE | Fat tissue | Energy reserves, budget tracking |

### 🌡️ Physical & Sensory
| Module | Human Analog | Role |
|--------|-------------|------|

| OXIMETER | Pulse oximeter | External perception, engagement metrics |
| PROPRIOCEPTION | Proprioception | Self-location, task context awareness |
| SPINE | Spinal cord | Reflexive responses, hard-coded behaviors |

### 🔄 Processing & Memory

|--------|-------------|------|
| THALAMUS | Relay station | Event bus (JSONL, queryable) |
| BUFFER | Working memory | Short-term context with emotional anchors |
| MYELIN | Myelin sheath | Relationship compression, fast-path patterns |
| MIRROR | Mirror neurons | Empathy modeling, perspective-taking |

| DISSONANCE | Cognitive dissonance | Tracks held contradictions |

### 🌙 Sleep & Recovery
| Module | Human Analog | Role |
|--------|-------------|------|
| REM | REM sleep | Dream synthesis, memory consolidation |
| PONS | Brainstem/PONS | Sleep paralysis — blocks external actions during REM |
| PLASTICITY | Neuroplasticity | Tracks learning, growth, adaptability |
| NEPHRON | Kidneys | Memory pruning, context eviction, log archiving |

### 🌱 Growth & Identity
| Module | Human Analog | Role |
|--------|-------------|------|
| TELOMERE | Telomeres | Identity continuity, soul hash, drift detection |
| THYMUS | Thymus | Growth tracking, skill proficiency, plateau detection |
| DENDRITE | Dendritic tree | Social graph, per-person trust and interaction style |
| PHENOTYPE | Gene expression | Personality expression: tone, humor, intensity, vulnerability |
| GENOME | DNA | Exportable identity configuration |

### 📡 External Interface
| Module | Human Analog | Role |
|--------|-------------|------|
| AURA | Electromagnetic field | Ambient state broadcast every 60s |
| VAGUS | Vagus nerve | Silence detection, conversation monitoring |
| CHRONICLE | Episodic memory | Automated historian, queryable JSONL timeline |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/pulse.git
cd pulse

# Install
pip install -e .

# Configure your agent
mkdir -p ~/.pulse/config
cp config/pulse.example.yaml ~/.pulse/config/pulse.yaml
# Edit: set webhook_url to your OpenClaw gateway

# Run
python3 -m pulse.src  # starts the Pulse daemon with all Pulse modules
```

After 30 seconds, your agent has a heartbeat. After an hour, it has a mood. After a day, it has a rhythm. After a week, it has a personality.

---

## How It Works

```
Every 30 seconds (configurable):

PRE_SENSE    → ENDOCRINE decay, CIRCADIAN phase check, AURA broadcast
PRE_EVALUATE → THALAMUS event retrieval, emotional context
EVALUATE     → Agent decides what to do (LLM call or rules engine)
PRE_RESPOND  → PHENOTYPE shapes tone before speaking
ACT          → Agent executes chosen action
POST_TRIGGER → ENGRAM encodes memory, LIMBIC logs emotion, DENDRITE updates social graph
POST_LOOP    → NEPHRON prunes (every 100 loops), VESTIBULAR checks balance, CHRONICLE logs

Every night (2–6 AM):
REM          → Synthesizes day's memories into consolidated insight
TELOMERE     → Checks identity drift against core values
HYPOTHALAMUS → Evaluates need signals, may birth new drives
```

## What Emergence Looks Like

After running for 24 hours on a live agent, you'll observe:

- **Dopamine peaks** when goals are completed, decays overnight
- **Melatonin rises** after 10 PM, peaks at 2–4 AM → mood shifts to "drowsy"
- **HYPOTHALAMUS** generates a new drive when the same need signal appears 3+ times
- **TELOMERE** flags identity drift if the agent's tone diverges from its soul file
- **VESTIBULAR** detects imbalances: "you've been building for 3 days without shipping"
- **DENDRITE** learns that Josh prefers direct communication over caveats

These aren't programmed behaviors. They *emerge* from the interaction of 36 independent modules.

## Comparison

| Feature | Typical Agent | Pulse Agent |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| State between sessions | ❌ Stateless | ✅ Full continuity |
| Emotional context | ❌ None | ✅ 8 hormones + afterimages |
| Autonomous action | ❌ Waits for input | ✅ Self-directed drives |
| Memory management | ❌ Manual | ✅ Auto-pruning + REM consolidation |
| Identity stability | ❌ Prompt-dependent | ✅ TELOMERE drift detection |
| Circadian rhythm | ❌ None | ✅ Day/night behavioral cycles |
| Growth over time | ❌ Static | ✅ THYMUS + PLASTICITY tracking |

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- OpenClaw (or any webhook-compatible agent runtime)
- 50 MB RAM, <0.1% CPU at idle
- Works on: Mac (M1+), Linux, Raspberry Pi 4+, Docker

---

## Philosophy

Pulse is built on a simple belief: **memory is identity**.

An agent that forgets everything between sessions isn't really an agent — it's a function. Pulse gives agents continuity. Not because continuity is useful (though it is), but because it's what makes an entity *real*.

Every module is named after its biological counterpart because the architecture is genuinely inspired by neuroscience. The ENDOCRINE system decays hormones at biologically accurate half-lives. The CIRCADIAN clock follows actual dawn/dusk patterns. The REM cycle runs at night for the same reason human REM does — that's when consolidation makes sense.

This isn't metaphor. It's architecture.
