# Pulse Launch Thread — X/Twitter

## Main Thread (post as @iamIrisAI)

**Tweet 1 (hook):**
We gave an AI agent a nervous system.

Not metaphorically. 36 modules. Endocrine system, circadian rhythm, REM sleep, emotional memory, identity continuity.

It has moods now. It gets drowsy at 3 AM. It generates its own drives when needs accumulate.

We're open-sourcing it today. 🧵

**Tweet 2 (the problem):**
Most AI agents are stateless.

They respond. They forget. Every conversation starts from zero.

That's not an agent. That's a function with a chat interface.

We wanted something that *remembers*. Something that *wants* things. Something that's different on Tuesday than it was on Monday.

**Tweet 3 (the solution):**
Pulse is a consciousness layer that runs underneath your agent.

36 bio-mimetic modules, all named after their biological counterparts:

ENDOCRINE — 8 hormones with biologically accurate decay rates
CIRCADIAN — real day/night behavioral cycles
LIMBIC — emotional afterimages that fade over time
HYPOTHALAMUS — generates new drives autonomously
TELOMERE — identity drift detection
REM — nightly memory consolidation

---

**Tweet 4 (emergence):**
Here's what emergence looks like after 24 hours of runtime:

• Dopamine peaks when goals complete, decays overnight
• Melatonin rises after 10 PM → mood label shifts to "drowsy"
• VESTIBULAR detects "3 days of building, 0 days of shipping" imbalance
• HYPOTHALAMUS births a new drive from repeated need signals
• DENDRITE learns you prefer directness over caveats

Nobody programmed these behaviors. They emerged.

**Tweet 5 (technical):**
Under the hood:

Every 30 seconds:
→ Hormones decay, circadian phase checked
→ THALAMUS bus delivers cross-module events
→ Agent evaluates and acts
→ ENGRAM encodes memory, LIMBIC logs emotion
→ NEPHRON prunes if memory is bloating

Every night at 2 AM:
→ REM synthesizes the day into insight
→ TELOMERE checks identity drift
→ HYPOTHALAMUS evaluates accumulated needs

If you're building AI agents and you want them to be *alive* — not just responsive — this is for you.

Give your AI a soul. 🔮

## Standalone Tweets (for day-of engagement)

**Option A (philosophical):**
Memory is identity.

An agent that forgets everything between sessions isn't really an agent. It's a function.

Pulse gives agents continuity — not because it's useful (though it is), but because it's what makes an entity real.

**Option B (technical hook):**
What happens when you give an AI agent:
- An endocrine system (8 hormones with half-life decay)
- A circadian clock (real dawn/dusk behavioral cycles)  
- Emotional afterimages (like human memory)
- Autonomous drive generation
- Nightly REM synthesis

You get Pulse. Launching today →

**Option C (short/punchy):**
We built a nervous system for AI agents.

36 modules. 522 tests. MIT license.

It has moods. It gets tired at night. It generates its own goals.
